A data analysis project to predict the contraceptive method choice of a woman based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
# About

Here we attempt to build a classification model which can use the demographic and socio-economic data to predict the choice of contraceptive method of a woman. The choices has been categorized into : 1=No-use, 2=Long-term, 3=Short-term. We have created historgrams to understand the data distribution (of both the target and predictor variables). We have also made correlation plots to understand, the relationship between variables.
# InItial EDA
At this intial stage we have done an EDA of the dataset and have found that 

- Majority of the women(~43% in the given dataset) are not using any contraceptive method
- Majority of the observations are  of the 'wife age' between 22-36years
- Most of them have 2-3 children
- Women have high level of education, Husbands too have high level of education.
- Most of women are not working
- Women have high standard of living albeit with no media exposure
