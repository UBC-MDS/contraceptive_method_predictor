# Summary

Here we attempt to build a predictive model using the SVC classifier algorithm which can help predict the use of contraceptive of a woman based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The target which was originally of 3 classes has been modified to 2 classes with target `1` defining usage of contraceptive (including short term and long term) and `0` defining no usage of contraceptive for simplicity and practical reasons. So now the predictive model has become a binary classification problem that we have explored in the project.

Our model performed fairly well on unseen data , with an overall accuracy of ~ 74% and the area under the curve (AUC) is of 78%. However the model still has a few false predictions for the non usage of contraceptive. These cases where false positives, that is predicting the usage of contraceptive when in fact the person does not use contraceptives. These kind of predictions give wrong insights of contraceptive usage, thus we feel further work to improve model prediction is needed before we could put this model in the real world.
