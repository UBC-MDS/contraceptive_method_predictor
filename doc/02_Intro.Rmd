# Introduction

In this project we are trying to answer the question: given the the demographic and socio-economic status: are we able to predict the usage of the contraceptive method (use vs no use)? Answering this question is important because of the adverse effects contraceptive's can have on a person's health based on the usage. Furthermore, it also gives us an understanding of the factors that could have contributed to the reasons behind why the contraceptive market is such a big industry in the health care sector right now. Here we approach this problem by using machine learning algorithm to predict a contraceptive method preferred by the individual given the women's demographic and socio-economic status.
